# Metro Train Controller

The scope of this following project is the simulation of a simplified metro train controller.
In order to work properly the controller must:
    - Increase and decrease speed according to the driver's commands;
    - Activate or deactivate regular brake commands issued by the driver;
    - Respond to emergency brake request;
    - Enforce stop commands by stop signals;
    - Manage communications between the train traffic manager and the driver.

The system is implemented using uVision 4.60 and the microprocessor STM32F10x.
